# Rtrees

* R tree bulk loading using the z-order space filling curve.  
* Range queries using the DFS algorithm to find the object MBR that intersects the query window (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax ).  
* Knn queries using the incremental BFS algorithm to find the k closest objects(neighbors) to the query point (x, y).
